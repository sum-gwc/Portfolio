		<p>I haven’t been able to actually go and code using Scratch (I do plan on it in my own time), but some of the actual commands are slightly different. Scratch also uses blocks and symbols; Python uses text.<br><br>
		I actually enjoy debugging a program because it’s like solving a puzzle and you get to immediately see a result once it is fixed. It was difficult today just because I was so new to python and don’t know how to do every command yet. Debugging generally didn’t take too long, but I did have to ask most of the time. It is easy to locate where the issue is but not always as easy to find what it asked for. This most difficult one was when I didn’t have a colon on the end of my for loop. It was also really fun getting to play with different commands because it couldn’t hurt the entire code.

		Variables: a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value<br><br>
		Loops: a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly<br><br>
		Functions: a body of code that returns a value<br><br>
		Conditionals: features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false

		<p>A list can store several values at once. You can use this to cycle and use different values in a loop, or give the user options. Today we wrote different programs that would randomly select a number of items from several lists to form one product. We learned the different functions you can do with a list as well. Lists are useful when trying to store data. We used lists to store the rgb values of an image, change these values, then store the new ones.</p>

		<p>As for right now, I mainly focused on trying to get the basic website set up. I am working on making the website accessible on different platforms so that it can be accessed easily on any device. I am also adding captions to every picture and video so that these will also be accessible if needed. Most of this will be added later on.<br><br>
		I really like the home page of Nicole Dominguez’s website. I am trying to do a setup similar to hers, but the code is very complex so I am trying to understand it and get the parts that I need. I mainly like how he site is set up to match ad screen size. So far I am probably most proud of learning how to set up a web page. I had no knowledge of html or css before this and it’s a very cool skill to have.
